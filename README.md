# train times

### Python + FastAPI CLI app for quick access to train timetables.

### I once made an Apple shortcut to provide easy access to National Rail (UK), SNCF (France) and SBB (Switzerland) train timetable websites through construction of URLs, and I soon got the idea to provide even faster, easier access with a Python frontend and FastAPI backend!
